    <p>The things I have learnt over the past week was all the basics in HTML and how to start up the core of websites. Gaining all the information on different HTML tags and being able to apply it and create something with that is really amazing. Everything from creating tables to creating surveys, it is really an interesting experience. Starting something you arent entirely familiar with and stepping out of your comfort zone to try something new really adds a thrill to it.</p>
